# Iron Fuzz

A quick single-serving website for January's Iron Fuzz competition. In the (near) future, I may redesign it to accomodate more months than just January.

## How?

I wanted to go with a look that was somewhere between pixel glitches (like the webcam glitches of my [twitter background](https://twitter.com/mathiasx) and cut-up, taped-up, and sharpied-up aesthetic of zines. I dunno what happened in the middle, but my coworker @missingdink encouraged me on, and this is the result.
